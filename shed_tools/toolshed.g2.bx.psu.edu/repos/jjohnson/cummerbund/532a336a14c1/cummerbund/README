This galaxy tool package includes a replacement variation of the cuffdiff wrapper that will generate an SQLite data base output that can be used directly in cummeRbund.
This cuffdiff builds the cummeRbund database from the cuffdiff output files in the working directory which includes the run.info output, 
thus it can populate the replicates information.
